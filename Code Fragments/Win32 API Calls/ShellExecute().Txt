' @precon  None.
' @postcon Opens or Prints a folder, EXE or file.
'
' @param   hwnd as a Long - Specifies a parent window. This window receives any message boxes
'          that an application produces. For example, an application may report an error by
'          producing a message box.
' @param   lpOperation as a String - Pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the
'          operation to perform. The following operation strings are valid:
'
'           String     Meaning
'          --------------------
'           "open"     The function opens the file specified by lpFile. The file can be an
'                      executable file or a document file. The file can be a folder to open.
'           "print"    The function prints the file specified by lpFile. The file should be a
'                      document file. If the file is an executable file, the function opens
'                      the file, as if "open" had been specified.
'           "explore"  The function explores the folder specified by lpFile.
'
'          The lpOperation parameter can be NULL. In that case, the function opens the file
'          specified by lpFile.
' @param   lpFile as a String - Pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the file
'          to open or print or the folder to open or explore. The function can open an
'          executable file or a document file. The function can print a document file.
' @param   lpParameters as a String - If lpFile specifies an executable file, lpParameters
'          is a pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies parameters to be passed
'          to the application. If lpFile specifies a document file, lpParameters should be NULL.
' @param   lpDirectory as a String - Pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the
'          default directory.
' @param   nShowCmd as a Long - If lpFile specifies an executable file, nShowCmd specifies
'          how the application is to be shown when it is opened. This parameter can be one
'          of the following values:
'
'           Value              Meaning
'          ----------------------------
'           SW_HIDE             Hides the window and activates another window.
'           SW_MAXIMIZE         Maximizes the specified window.
'           SW_MINIMIZE         Minimizes the specified window and activates the next
'                               top-level window in the Z order.
'           SW_RESTORE          Activates and displays the window. If the window is
'                               minimized or maximized, Windows restores it to its original
'                               size and position. An application should specify this flag when
'                               restoring a minimized window.
'           SW_SHOW             Activates the window and displays it in its current size and
'                               position.
'           SW_SHOWDEFAULT      Sets the show state based on the SW_ flag specified in the
'                               STARTUPINFO structure passed to the CreateProcess function by
'                               the program that started the application. An application should
'                               call ShowWindow with this flag to set the initial show state of
'                               its main window.
'           SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED    Activates the window and displays it as a maximized window.
'           SW_SHOWMINIMIZED    Activates the window and displays it as a minimized window.
'           SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE  Displays the window as a minimized window. The active window
'                               remains active.
'           SW_SHOWNA           Displays the window in its current state. The active window
'                               remains active.
'           SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE   Displays a window in its most recent size and position. The
'                               active window remains active.
'           SW_SHOWNORMAL       Activates and displays a window. If the window is minimized or
'                               maximized, Windows restores it to its original size and position.
'                               An application should specify this flag when displaying
'                               the window for the first time.
'
'          If lpFile specifies a document file, nShowCmd should be zero.
' @return  a Long - If the function succeeds, the return value is the instance handle of the
'          application that was run, or the handle of a dynamic data exchange (DDE) server
'          application. If the function fails, the return value is an error value that is
'          less than or equal to 32. The following table lists these error values:
'
'          Value                    Meaning
'          0                        The operating system is out of memory or resources.
'          ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND     The specified file was not found.
'          ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND     The specified path was not found.
'          ERROR_BAD_FORMAT         The .EXE file is invalid (non-Win32 .EXE or error in .EXE image).
'          SE_ERR_ACCESSDENIED      The operating system denied access to the specified file.
'          SE_ERR_ASSOCINCOMPLETE   The filename association is incomplete or invalid.
'          SE_ERR_DDEBUSY           The DDE transaction could not be completed because other DDE
'                                   transactions were being processed.
'          SE_ERR_DDEFAIL           The DDE transaction failed.
'          SE_ERR_DDETIMEOUT        The DDE transaction could not be completed because the
'                                   request timed out.
'          SE_ERR_DLLNOTFOUND       The specified dynamic-link library was not found.
'          SE_ERR_FNF               The specified file was not found.
'          SE_ERR_NOASSOC           There is no application associated with the given filename
'                                   extension.
'          SE_ERR_OOM               There was not enough memory to complete the operation.
'          SE_ERR_PNF               The specified path was not found.
'          SE_ERR_SHARE             A sharing violation occurred.
'
' @Remark  The file specified by the lpFile parameter can be a document file or an executable
'          file. If the file is a document file, the ShellExecute function opens or prints it,
'          depending on the value of the lpOperation parameter. If the file is an executable
'          file, the ShellExecute function opens it, even if lpOperation specifies printing.
'          You can use ShellExecute to open or explore a shell folder. To open a folder, use
'          either of the following calls:
'
'          ShellExecute(handle, NULL, path_to_folder, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL);
'
'          or
'
'          ShellExecute(handle, "open", path_to_folder, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL);
'
'          To explore a folder, use the following call:
'
'          ShellExecute(handle, "explore", path_to_folder, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL);
'
'          If lpOperation is NULL, the function opens the file specified by lpFile. If
'          lpOperation is "open" or "explore", the function will force an open window or explorer.
