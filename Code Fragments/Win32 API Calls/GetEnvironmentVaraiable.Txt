'
' The GetEnvironmentVariable function retrieves the value of the specified
' variable from the environment block of the calling process. The value is
' in the form of a null-terminated string of characters.
'
' DWORD GetEnvironmentVariable(
'    LPCTSTR lpName, // address of environment variable name
'    LPTSTR lpBuffer,  // address of buffer for variable value
'    DWORD nSize   // size of buffer, in characters
'   );
'
' @precon  nBufferLength must be set to the length of a valid lpBuffer.
' @postcon Function retrieves the value of the specified
'          variable from the environment block of the calling process.
'
' @param   lpName as a String - Points to a null-terminated string that
'          specifies the environment variable.
' @param   lpBuffer as a String - Points to a buffer to receive the value of
'          the specified environment variable.
' @param   nSize as a Long - Specifies the size, in characters, of the buffer
'          pointed to by the lpBuffer parameter.
'
' @return  a Long - If the function succeeds, the return value is the number of
'                   characters stored into the buffer pointed to by lpBuffer,
'                   not including the terminating null character.
'                   If the specified environment variable name was not found in
'                   the environment block for the current process, the return
'                   value is zero.
'                   If the buffer pointed to by lpBuffer is not large enough, the
'                   return value is the buffer size, in characters, required to
'                   hold the value string and its terminating null character.
