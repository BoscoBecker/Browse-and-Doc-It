' The EnableWindow function enables or disables mouse and keyboard input to the

' receives all input.

'
' @param   hWnd as a Long - Identifies the window to be enabled or disabled.
' @param   bEnable as a Long - Specifies whether to enable or disable the window.
'          If this parameter is TRUE, the window is enabled. If the parameter is FALSE,
'          the window is disabled.
' @return  a Long - If the window was previously disabled, the return value is nonzero.
'          If the window was not previously disabled, the return value is zero. To get
'          extended error information, call GetLastError.
'
' @remarks If the enabled state of a window is changing, a WM_ENABLE message is sent
'          before the EnableWindow function returns. If a window is already disabled, all
'          its child windows are implicitly disabled, although they are not sent a
'          WM_ENABLE message. A window must be enabled before it can be activated. For
'          example, if an application is displaying a modeless dialog box and has
'          disabled its main window, the application must enable the main window before
'          destroying the dialog box. Otherwise, another window will receive the keyboard
'          focus and be activated. If a child window is disabled, it is ignored when
'          Windows tries to determine which window should receive mouse messages.
'
'          By default, a window is enabled when it is created. To create a window that
'          is initially disabled, an application can specify the WS_DISABLED style in the
'          CreateWindow or CreateWindowEx function. After a window has been created, an
'          application can use EnableWindow to enable or disable the window. An application
'          can use this function to enable or disable a control in a dialog box. A
'          disabled control cannot receive the keyboard focus, nor can a user gain access
'          to it.
