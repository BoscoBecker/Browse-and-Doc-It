' The GetComputerName function retrieves the computer name of the current
' system. This name is established at system startup, when it is initialized
' from the registry.

'
' @param   lpBuffer as a String - Points to a buffer to receive the
'          null-terminated character string containing the computer name.
' @param   nSize as a Long - Points to a variable that specifies the maximum
'          size, in characters, of the buffer. This value should be large enough
'          to contain MAX_COMPUTERNAME_LENGTH + 1 characters.
'
' @return  a Long - If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero and
'          the variable represented by the nSize parameter contains the number
'          of characters copied to the destination buffer, not including the
'          terminating null character. If the function fails, the return value
'          is zero. To get extended error information, call GetLastError.
