' @postcon Function retrieves the user name of the current thread
'
' @param   lpBuffer as a String - Points to the buffer to receive the
'          null-terminated string containing the user's logon name. If this
'          buffer is not large enough to contain the entire user name, the
'          function fails.
' @param   nSize as a Long - Pointer to a DWORD that, on input, specifies the
'          maximum size, in characters, of the buffer specified by the lpBuffer
'          parameter. If this buffer is not large enough to contain the entire
'          user name, the function fails. If the function succeeds, it will
'          place the number of characters copied to the buffer into the DWORD
'          that nSize points to.
'
' @return  a Long - If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero, and
'          the variable pointed to by nSize contains the number of characters
'          copied to the buffer specified by lpBuffer, including the terminating
'          null character. If the function fails, the return value is zero. To
'          get extended error information, call GetLastError.
'
' @remark  If the current thread is impersonating another client, the
'          GetUserName function returns the user name of the client that the
'          thread is impersonating.
